## About
I wanted to create a simple and clean way to easily grab tide data from your current location.  Many tide websites make it difficult to search for tides based on where you are and instead mostly default to knowing tide stations.  There usually is also a lot of unnecessary information and I normally prefer to only see certain details about the forecast. 

## Live 
I currently have an example deployed using AWS Amplify along with API Gateway and Lambda running a reverse proxy server.

## Roadmap
Future additions aim to make the experience more customizable but also keep it relatively clean and simple.

- [ ] Add Marker differentiation for reporting station
- [ ] Manual Mode for tuning forecast to your liking
- [ ] Default Station Mode vs Your Location Mode Switch
- [ ] User Support
    - [ ] Save Forecast Preferences
    - [ ] Save Preferred Tide Stations
    - [ ] "Tide Windows" - Quickly read the window of time tides will be high enough to comfortably boat and be alerted when your availability matches a tide forecast
    - [ ] Add "home" or "pinch point" forecast offset so that you can decide when the tide is right for you in relation             to a reporting station.
